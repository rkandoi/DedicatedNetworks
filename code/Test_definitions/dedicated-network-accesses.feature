Feature: CAMARA Dedicated Network API, wip - Network Accesses API Operations
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * At least one existing dedicated network
  # * Valid device identifier (phoneNumber or networkAccessIdentifier)
  # * At least one existing network access
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in dedicated-network-accesses.yaml

  Background: Common accesses setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" is set to a string value
