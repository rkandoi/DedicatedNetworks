Feature: CAMARA Dedicated Network API, wip - Network Profiles API Operations
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * At least one existing network profile
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in dedicated-network-profiles.yaml

  Background: Common profiles setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" is set to a string value

  # Success scenarios for GET /profiles

  @dedicated_network_profiles_readNetworkProfiles_01_success
  Scenario: List all available network profiles
    Given the resource "/dedicated-network-profiles/0.1/profiles"
    When the request "readNetworkProfiles" is sent
    Then the response status code is 200
    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response header "x-correlator" has the same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And the response body is an array where each item complies with the OAS schema at "/components/schemas/NetworkProfile"
    And each item in the response array has properties "id", "maxNumberOfDevices", "aggregatedUlThroughput", "aggregatedDlThroughput", "qosProfiles", "defaultQosProfile"

  # Success scenarios for GET /profiles/{profileId}

  @dedicated_network_profiles_readNetworkProfile_01_success
  Scenario: Get details of a specific network profile
    Given an existing network profile
    And the resource "/dedicated-network-profiles/0.1/profiles/{profileId}"
    And the path parameter "profileId" is set to the ID of the existing profile
    When the request "readNetworkProfile" is sent
    Then the response status code is 200
    And the response header "Content-Type" is "application/json"
    And the response header "x-correlator" has the same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And the response body complies with the OAS schema at "/components/schemas/NetworkProfile"
    And the response property "$.id" is equal to the path parameter "profileId"
    And the response property "$.qosProfiles" exists and is a non-empty array
    And the response property "$.defaultQosProfile" exists and is included in "$.qosProfiles"
