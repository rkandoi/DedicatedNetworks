  * request/modify/delete a (logical) Dedicated Network for API consumers.
  * A Dedicated Network offers
    * specific connectivity performance (e.g. speed/ latency)
    * during a specific time duration (e.g. one hour) and
    * at specific locations (e.g. the area of a festival)
  * A Dedicated Network may be ensured by an SLA.
  * API consumers are able to manage access to this dedicated network for specific devices.
* Describe, develop, document, and test the APIs
* Started: October 2024
